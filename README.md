**A collection of cool rust ecosystem projects**

## ML
- [MOSEC](https://github.com/mosecorg/mosec) ML model serving framework

## Misc

- [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) framework for making desktop apps. So far the most popular rust code base I've seen. 66.5k starts on github!
- [C2Rust](https://c2rust.com/) C to Rust code translator.
- [rusty-celery](https://github.com/rusty-celery/rusty-celery) Celery implementation with AMQP brokers.
- [perseus](https://github.com/framesurge/perseus) NextJs in Rust
- [Qdrant](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant) Vector similarity engine and vector datasbase

## Tools:

- [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) Modern terminal written in Rust with GPU acceleration.
  - beautifull selection of themes, jellyfish ❤️
  - command palettes
  - workflows
  - AI assitant
 - [Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst) Markup-based typesetting with collaborative document editor, modern LaTeX alternative
 - [ripgrep(rg)](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) fast implementation of grep, which respects dot files and binary files.
 - [aquascope](https://github.com/cognitive-engineering-lab/aquascope) visualization of Rust's compile-time and run-time behaviour.
 - [rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io) Rust's LSP - provides code completion, type annotation, go-to definition features for editors like vim, VS Code, so with it, it's possible to make vim your customizably configured IDE, isn't that cool?! :)
 - [sudo-rs](https://github.com/memorysafety/sudo-rs) an attempt to create a drop in replacement of sudo written in Rust. Love this :)

## Block-chain:
- [solana](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana) Just stummbled upon it.

## Books & Blogs & articles & papers:

- [Intro to rust](https://applied-math-coding.medium.com/list/an-introduction-into-rust-22c99777c5e5) blogpost series written from the perspective of mathematician
- [How Rust went from a side project to the world’s most-loved programming language](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/02/14/1067869/rust-worlds-fastest-growing-programming-language/) inspirational MIT tech review article by Clive Thompson
- [Why I find Rust interesting](https://shiver.github.io/post/why_i_find_rust_interesting/) a blogpost by Robert Vally
- [Energy Efficiency across Programming Languages](https://greenlab.di.uminho.pt/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sleFinal.pdf) Nice paper which compares energy efficency across programming languages. Takeaway Rust is around  2x more energy efficient than Java.
- [Rust cookbook](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/intro.html)
- [Comprehensive overview or Rust GUI libraries](https://monadical.com/posts/shades-of-rust-gui-library-list.html#)
- [testing sudo-rs](https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/testing-sudo-rs/) blog post about testing sudo-rs implemented in Rust.
- [modern cmd rust tool](https://zaiste.net/posts/shell-commands-rust/) I like this list of well-know cmd tools reimplemnted in Rust, though their names are weird!

## Workshops/courses:

- [Comprehensive rust](https://github.com/google/comprehensive-rust) Well structured 3 full-day workshop on Rust from Google. So far I enjoy it's structure. They also use interesting examples as [Collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture)
